    Type: 60
    Description: 'Let''s experiment if it is doable to feature multiple camera angle
      dialogues. Each NPC gets several camera positions. These could include:

      -shot on npc

      -shot on Emmon

      -close up npc

      -close up Emmon

      -other angles, such as top down.

      Per dialogue line a different, appropriate angle can be determined.


      Further exploration could include moving camera angles, zooming camera angles
      and tilting camera angles.'
