		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="11074">
			<Speaker>Ay</Speaker>
			<Text>Some would call it luck, I just think that Benny had chosen a bad time for his plan. As it happened I couldn’t enter my house at the time, as I had lost my keys.</Text>
			<DialogueType>AyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="11075">
			<Speaker>Ay</Speaker>
			<Text>As I was investigating the soil around my house in order to find them, I localised the banana. After that neutralising it was only a matter of exercising the right skills.</Text>
